# CreditCardFraudData
A free Kaggle dataset tracking two days' worth European credit card transactions, some labeled fraudulant

The first 28 columns are the results of PCA on the data. The "Time" column tracks the time elapsed since the first transaction recorded. "Amount" is the actual euro(?) value of the transaction, and "Class" describes whether the transaction was labeled as fraudulent, (1 is fraudulant, 0 is not)
